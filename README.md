Exploration of the Sieve of Eratosthenes
----------------------------------------


A number of years ago I was playing with the Sieve of Eratosthenes and 
noticed that when iterating through the list of integers and marking the
composites that the gaps between numbers that were marked by that particular
prime, had interesting patterns.  I found the following properties:
- the first composite knocked out was always the square of the prime
- the gaps were were always even multiples of the prime being iterated
- the gaps had very distictive similarities

The page displayed at http://sammyoos.github.io/EratoFun shows this pattern
as best as I could to demonstrate the similarities.  I have, for some time,
tried to figure if the numbers are predictable, but so far have not had success.

The page displayed, shows the gap between composites knocked out the by each 
prime being interated over (divided by because all the gaps are even).  Each
row is also shifted over by one, to highlight the similarities between the rows.
